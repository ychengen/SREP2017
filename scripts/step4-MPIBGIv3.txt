Descriptions by:Cheng-En Yang

1. NetCDF data is processed and converted to GeoTiff while maintaining 1-by-1 degree horizontal resolution.
2. The tiff files are futher used for remapping 1-by-1 km (grid resolution) GLC2000 data product.
3. The range (min/max) of MPI-BGI biomass data is computed by adding/substracting the uncertainty value.
4. Biomass in wood is defined as the sum of the biomass in branches and that in stem.
5. Files are named as 
BGI_Tbio_1km.nc BGI_Tbio_un_1km.nc 
BGI_Bbio_1km.nc BGI_Bbio_un_1km.nc 
BGI_cLeaf_1km.nc BGI_cLeaf_un_1km.nc 
BGI_cWood_1km.nc BGI_cWood_un_1km.nc

Tbio = total; Bbio = roots; cLeaf = foilages; cWood = branches+stem; un = uncertainty
