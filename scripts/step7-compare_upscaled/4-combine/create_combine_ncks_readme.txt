(1) Make sure 3 data sets are generated by runnig NCL scripts in

1-forest_types/masked
2-individual_type/masked
3-meteorology/masked

(2) Run 4 bash scripts
  create_combine_ncks_forest*.sh
  create_combine_ncks_individual*.sh

The scripts are used to create the combined results of biomass
carbon density and meteorological data in a single file for
each CMIP5 model.

The new datasets are stored in two folders under
step8-correlation/ within the subfolder modern/ and PI/
