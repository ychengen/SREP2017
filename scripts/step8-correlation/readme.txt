1. Input files are generated from 
(1) step6-upscale/forest_types/create_combine_ncks_modern.sh
(2) step6-upscale/forest_types/create_combine_ncks_PI.sh

2. Folder scripts/ contains the running scripts for both modern and PI cases
   Results are stored in ../../../postanalysis/correlation/ for both modern and PI cases

3. Only run lumped forest types for forest fraction >0, >0.2, >0.5, >0.8

4. Please contact Dr. Shilong Piao (slpiao@pku.edu.cn) to obtain the Matlab scripts
   plotting the spatial maps of the correlations between climate variables and forest
   biomass.
